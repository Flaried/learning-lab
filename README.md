# Technologies to learn 🐕
> ⚠️ This Repo will be under active development.  
> Everything in this Repo is for my personal use for note taking/tracking. ⚠️

## Operating Systems 💿
- Virtual vs Physical memory
- Buffers and caching
- Deadlock and avoidance
- Stack vs. heap memory

## Algorithms 🔃
- Searching Algorithms
- Sorting Algorithms
- Loops and Recursion
- Simple traversals: BFS and DFS
- Analyze time and space complexity (Big O notation)
- Solve leetcode problems

## Networking 📬
- TCP
- UDP
- OSI Model
- DNS
- TLS/SSL
- SMTP (Application Layer)
- ICMP

## Concurrency 🦀
- Processes vs Threads
- Locks and Semaphores
- Race conditions, deadlocks, livelocks
- Thread Creation and Management
- Message Passing and Shared Memory (Channels Go & Rust) 

## Computer Architecture  🖥️
- CPU Design and Instruction Execution
- Memory Hierarchy (Registers -> Caches -> RAM -> Disk)
- Parallelism
- CPI (cycles per instruction), MIPS, FLOPS
- I/O and Storage
- Implement a 1-bit ALU, register file, or cache simulator

## Projects for my career
- Launch an app using Go, Templ, HTMX. and Grafana for logging.
- Automatically manage Ninja software using APIs built in golang.
