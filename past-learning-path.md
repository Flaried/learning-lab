# üß† 2019-2024 Learning Path Overview

I've been coding in **Python for 5 years**, primarily self taught. During this time, I've developed strong practical skills by building projects and solving problems through Googling and hands-on experimentation. I'm very comfortable with Python and general programming workflows.

Most of my experience has been in writing simple programs using libraries like requests, often involving:
>
>    - Authentication (using cookies, CSRF tokens, etc.)
>
>    - Interacting with web APIs
>
>    - Scripting, scraping and automation
>    
>    - Making my own APIs, database and server for authenticating my software buyers
>
>    - Learning how to manage big codebases with 3k+ lines of my python project

However, I‚Äôve realized that I‚Äôve neglected foundational concepts in:
>
>   - Algorithms and Data Structures
>
>   - Computer Architecture
>
>   - Low Level Concepts like memory managment and concurrency
>
>   - Databases (though I've built basic ones before using postgres)
>
>   - Simple Networking Concepts 

Although these topics weren't essential for the kinds of Python automation projects I built, These are very important for writing efficient, scalable, and maintainable software.

# üîÅ Recent Shift in Focus for 2025
Lately ive switched to learning Go + Rust, This shift has recently given me a more desirable & clearer learning path. 

I‚Äôve been diving into concepts like structs, traits, and statically typed programming, and I find myself enjoying it, despite it taking more time to write code compared to Python. 

While I appreciate both languages, I‚Äôve decided to focus more on Golang, since backend development in Go aligns more with my long-term goals.
Rust is insanely powerful but I find Go more practical for the me, as I want to code the backend of servers.



At the end of the day to grow as a developer and improve my technical understanding, I‚Äôm now focusing on learning the core CS fundamentals.
