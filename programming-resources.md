# Programming Resources ðŸ§ 
A curated list of personal resources I find helpful for learning and improving in programming.
## Learning Platforms
### [Codecrafters](https://codecrafters.io/)
For applying knowledge to building real world applications like Git, Docker and Redis from scratch.
### [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) 
Great for practicing algorithms and technical interview problems.
### [Neetcode](https://neetcode.io/) 
Very clean roadmaps for Leetcode thats developed by a Youtuber: [NeetCode](https://www.youtube.com/@NeetCode)
### [Exercism](https://exercism.org/)
A fun and beginner-friendly site for learning programming languages through small exercises.
### [Harvard CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/)
Harvard Universityâ€™s introduction to computer science, theres two CS50 certificates: one is paid (EDX) and the other is [FREE](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/sg9w3j/is_it_worth_my_money_if_i_pay_harvard_onlines/).
